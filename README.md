**Rules of the game:**
Peruke Game is a game of chance and a dice game of strategy and luck. Two players have 6 numbered disks (from 1 to 6). Players roll the dice one at a time and can choose either to attack an opponent’s disk or protect her or his own disk. Players can attack or protect only a disk whose number fell on the cube. If a player chooses to attack an unprotected disk, it becomes the killed one and there are no actions with this disk anymore. If a player chooses to attack a protected disk, it becomes an unprotected one. If a player chooses to protect their own disk, it becomes a protected one. In this game implementation, users are asked to set the number of rounds (number of dice rolls) after which the game ends. The more the non-killed disks player has, the more the points player will have:
Protected disk – 2 points, Unprotected disk – 1 point, Killed disk – 0 points.

**Modes:**
It is possible to choose two types of gameplay: single-player and multiplayer. 
Single-player mode provides an opportunity to play with a virtual computer competing with it. Multiplayer mode helps to play two people on the same computer who choose whether attack or protect disks one at a time. 

**Set up:**
In order to successfully run the program, it is needed to download a ZIP file that consists of two main files called “PerukeMainGame.py” and “usersInitialisation.py” as well as supporting files from this GitHub repository. Run the “PerukeMainGame.py” program via Pycharm. The program will start running in Python Terminal at the bottom of the screen. A welcome description of the purple program should appear.
